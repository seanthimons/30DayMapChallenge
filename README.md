| 01-11-2024 | Points                | 30DayMapChallenge classic: A map with points. Start the challenge with points. Show individual locations—anything from cities to trees or more abstract concepts. Simple, but a key part of the challenge. 📍                                    |
| 02-11-2024 | Lines                 | 30DayMapChallenge classic: A map with focus on lines. Roads, rivers, routes, or borders—this day is all about mapping connections and divisions. Another traditional way to keep things moving. 📏                                             |
| 03-11-2024 | Polygons              | 30DayMapChallenge classic: A map with polygons. Regions, countries, lakes—this day is for defined shapes that fill space. 🛑                                                                                                                     |
| 04-11-2024 | Hexagons              | Maps using hexagonal grids. Step away from square grids and try mapping with hexagons. A fun way to show density or spatial patterns. 🔷                                                                                                          |
| 05-11-2024 | A journey             | Map any journey. Personal or not. Trace a journey—this could be a daily commute, a long-distance trip, or something from history. The key is to map movement from one place to another. 🚶‍♂️✈️                                               |
| 06-11-2024 | Raster                | A map using raster data. Rasters are everywhere, but today’s focus is purely on grids and pixels—satellite imagery, heatmaps, or any continuous surface data. 🟦🟧                                                                             |

| 08-11-2024 | Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) | Use data from HDX to map humanitarian topics. Explore the datasets from the Humanitarian Data Exchange, covering disaster response, health, population, and development. Map for social good. 🌍🚑                                     |
| 09-11-2024 | AI only               | This day is all about prompt engineering. Use AI tools like DALL-E, MidJourney, Stable Diffusion, or ChatGPT with geospatial capabilities to create a map based on AI-generated content. The challenge is to get the right prompt and critically assess the output—how well does AI capture or distort the map's intent? |
| 10-11-2024 | Pen & paper           | Draw a map by hand. Go analog and draw a map using pen and paper. The result doesn’t have to be perfect—it’s about the creative process. ✏️🗺️                                                                                                  |

| 30-11-2024 | The final map         | The final challenge—your choice! Revisit a technique from earlier in the month, refine an idea, or try something completely new. End the challenge on a high note with a map that showcases your creativity, growth, or just pure fun! 🎉🌐        |



The idea is to create maps based around different themes each day of November using the hashtag `#30DayMapChallenge`. You can prepare the maps beforehand, but the main idea is to publish maps on the dedicated days. Just include a picture of the map when you post to X/Instagram/Linkedin (or your preferred social media platforms) using the hashtag. You don't have to sign up anywhere to participate. There are no restrictions on the tools, technologies or the data you use in your maps. Doing less than 30 is also fine. See the *Code of Conduct* at the bottom of the page.
